# mapty--Map-your-workout
A javascript application to track your workout. It asks you about your workout, and then pin point on the map with date and your workout details
The application uses Leaflet library for rendering map.
You can pin point on the map, on which a form renders to ask details of your workout, (Type: Running/ Cycling, Distance, Duration, Cadence/ Elevation Gain). After successfully filling the form, the workout data gets saved in a list with information: Date of workout, Distance, Duration, Speed etc. And it pin points the data on the map, so you can know when, where and how have you burnt your calories.

Have a great Workout Session :)
